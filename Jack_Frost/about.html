   <h1>OUR HISTORY…</h1>
<p>In 1983, David Dubinsky arrived in Virginia Beach as an adventurous 23-year-old with $500 in his pocket. He started Jack Frost Firewood Company and delivered cords of seasoned firewood. After adding bulk deliveries of screened topsoil, mulch, and sand, the business expanded. By 2000, it grew into an award-winning company, Jack Frost Landscapes and Garden Center.</p>

<p>With the continued success of the company, David bought the space for the current garden center in Virginia Beach. This location functions as a full-service garden center. Here we offer a variety of high-quality plants, trees, shrubs, and a wide selection of seasonal color. In addition, we have a selection of hard goods, such as fertilizers, pest solutions, and garden decor. It is also the hub for our bulk materials pickup and delivery options.</p>

    <p>Over the years Jack Frost Landscapes expanded its knowledge of the Green Industry and built a team of experienced landscape professionals.</p>

<h1>TODAY…</h1>
<p>We are the premier provider of landscape construction and maintenance. We provide services to commercial, multi-family, industrial, and municipal properties. Our team works to match the needs of your site through proactive attention and clear, consistent communication.</p>
